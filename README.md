TrotroLive Digitising Transportation Information.
 
TrotroLive aims to make Trotro (shared minibus system in Ghana) transport information readily available for 3.5 million Accra, Kumasi, and Obuasi commuters. Trotro.Live is a pioneering initiative in Ghana working towards digitising transportation information. They envision making transportation more accessible, efficient, and economically viable.

 

Transportation plays a crucial role in the economic development of a country. In Ghana, “Trotros” are privately owned mini-buses that serve as a significant mode of public transport and are widely used by millions of commuters daily. However, the lack of readily available information on Trotro fares and routes can lead to inefficiencies, inconveniences, and safety concerns for passengers and drivers. Trotro.Live aims to address these challenges by digitising Trotro Fares and providing a peer-to-peer sending service for items through pickup lockers while exploring business-to-business opportunities.

 

The platform aims to be a bridge between station managers and passengers, providing a seamless experience for all, which includes updating Trotro Fares through the dashboard, reporting missing items, and facilitating peer-to-peer item sending.

 

The Trotro.Live App aims to improve price transparency and reduce information asymmetry between passengers and drivers. This leads to more efficient fare negotiations and reduces the likelihood of overcharging or disputes. Moreover, the peer-to-peer sending service for items enables faster and more convenient deliveries, benefiting businesses and individuals alike.

These efficiency gains result in time and cost savings for passengers and businesses, contributing to economic growth. The development of Troto.Live will create employment opportunities and stimulate economicactivity in logistics and e-commerce.

In five years, we are looking to digitalise transportation information nationwide, with an efficient well-monitored Peer 2 Peer sending of parcels nationwide,
